Spam Message Detection
Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to build a model that can accurately detect spam messages. 
With the rise of digital communication, spam messages have become a nuisance and a 
potential security threat. Spam messages are unsolicited messages that are often sent in 
bulk to a large number of recipients. They can include advertisements, phishing 
attempts, malware links, or other types of unwanted content.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning and deep learning-based 
solution that can automatically classify messages as either spam or legitimate. By 
accurately identifying spam messages, we can help users filter out unwanted content, 
protect against potential scams, and enhance overall communication safety.
Dataset Information: The dataset used for this project consists of text messages from 
various sources, including Yelp, Amazon, and IMDb. The dataset contains two columns: 
"sentence" and "label." The "sentence" column contains the text content of the 
messages, and the "label" column indicates whether a message is spam (1) or not spam 
(0).
The dataset is divided into separate files for each source, and the code provided reads 
and combines these files into a single dataframe. This allows for a more comprehensive
analysis and training of the spam message detection model.
Background Information: Spam message detection is a classic problem in the field of 
natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It involves processing and 
analyzing textual data to determine if a message is legitimate or spam. Various 
techniques have been employed to tackle this problem, ranging from traditional 
machine learning algorithms to more advanced deep learning models.
In this project, the code utilizes two main approaches: logistic regression and neural 
networks. Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks 
and is capable of learning linear decision boundaries. On the other hand, neural 
networks, particularly deep learning models, have shown great promise in handling 
complex patterns and capturing the semantic meaning of text.
By combining these techniques and leveraging the power of machine learning and deep 
learning, the aim is to build an accurate and robust spam message detection system 
that can effectively identify and filter out unwanted content.
The provided code demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression and neural 
network models on the spam message dataset. It showcases how text data can be 
processed, transformed into numerical representations, and used to train models for 
classification purposes. The evaluation of model performance and visualization of 
training history are also demonstrated.
Overall, this project serves as a starting point for developing a spam message detection 
system that can be further enhanced and deployed to ensure safer and more secure 
digital communication
